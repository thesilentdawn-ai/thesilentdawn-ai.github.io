                    Veilglass develops compact, machine-readable intent systems that make complex operations verifiable at scale.
                    Our technology allows organizations to declare, transmit, and validate operational intent using deterministic logic,
                    enabling rapid distinction between authorized activity and anomalies in regulated or high-risk environments.

                <h2>Our Technology</h2>
                <div class="tech-section">
                    <h3>System Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Veilglass technology focuses on a single problem that most systems leave unresolved: validating why an operation is occurring, not just where or how.
                        The system provides a standardized way to declare operational intent, bind it to an authorization record, and verify it deterministically during execution.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Intent Cartouches</h3>
                    <p>
                        An intent cartouche is a compact identifier that represents a declared mission or operational purpose.
                        Cartouches are designed to be machine-readable, registry-backed, and suitable for constrained telemetry
                        environments when required. They allow intent to be communicated alongside existing operational data without
                        replacing current signaling or sensor infrastructure.
                    </p>

                    <h3>FIS-32 Intent Validation</h3>
                    <p>
                        FIS-32 is a software-defined intent-validation protocol that supports issuing, verifying, and auditing intent declarations at scale.
                        A typical flow includes cartouche issuance, registry association, real-time verification, and tamper-evident activity logging.
                        Reference implementations emphasize deterministic behavior to support evaluation, testing, and compliance review.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Capabilities</h3>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li>Compact Intent Encoding: Encodes declared intent into identifiers designed for constrained transmission and fast parsing.</li>
                        <li>Registry Backed Verification: Validates observed operations against authorized mission records.</li>
                        <li>Deterministic reference kernel: Designed for repeatable outcomes and transparent evaluation under test.</li>
                        <li>Tamper-evident logging: Generates hash-linked activity records suitable for audit and after-action analysis.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Operational Fit</h3>
                    <p>
                        Veilglass technology is designed for environments where authorization, attribution, and auditability matter.
